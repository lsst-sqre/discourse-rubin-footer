        Financial support for Rubin Observatory comes from the National Science
        Foundation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</a>) through Cooperative
        Agreement No. 1258333, the Department of Energy (
        <a href="https://www.energy.gov">DOE</a>) Office of Science under Contract
        No. DE-AC02-76SF00515, and private funding raised by the
        <a href="http://www.lsstcorporation.org/">LSST Corporation</a>. The
        NSF-funded Rubin Observatory Project Office for construction was
        established as an operating center under management of the Association of
        Universities for Research in Astronomy (
        <a href="http://www.aura-astronomy.org/">AURA</a>). The DOE-funded effort
        to build the Rubin Observatory LSST Camera (LSSTCam) is managed by the
        SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (
        <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/">SLAC</a>).

        The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency
        created by
        <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/od/ogc/leg.jsp">Congress</a> in 1950 to
        promote the progress of science. NSF supports basic research and people to
        create knowledge that transforms the future. NSF and DOE will continue to
        support Rubin Observatory in its Operations phase. They will also provide
        support for scientific research with LSST data.
