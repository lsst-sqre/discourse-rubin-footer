They will also provide support for scientific research with the data. During operations, NSF funding is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (<a href="https://www.aura-astronomy.org/">AURA</a>) under a cooperative agreement with NSF, and DOE funding is managed by SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (<a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/">SLAC</a>), under contract by DOE. Rubin Observatory is operated by <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/">NSF NOIRLab</a> and SLAC.</p>

      <p>NSF is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1950 to promote the progress of science. NSF supports basic research and people to create knowledge that transforms the future.</p>

      <p>The DOE Office of Science is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States and is working to address some of the most pressing challenges of our time.</p>
